Ecommerce Prototype created for Ara's BCDE224 PHP course.

This is a fully functioning Ecommerce website with front end functionality and back-end connectivity to dataase. 

Users can create accounts, login, add items for sale and make business connections.

A great baseline to extend for a business-level commerce website.
